# House Price Prediction using Linear Regression

This repository contains an implementation of a linear regression model to predict house prices based on square footage, number of bedrooms, and number of bathrooms. The project aims to provide a simple and efficient way to estimate house prices using basic features.

## Introduction
House price prediction is a common use case in the real estate industry. By utilizing features such as square footage, number of bedrooms, and number of bathrooms, this project demonstrates how linear regression can be used to predict house prices.

## Data
The dataset should include the following columns:<br>

square_footage: The size of the house in square feet.<br>
bedrooms: The number of bedrooms in the house.<br>
bathrooms: The number of bathrooms in the house.<br>
price: The price of the house (target variable).<br>

## Model
The linear regression model is built using the scikit-learn library. The features used for prediction are:<br>

Square footage<br>
Number of bedrooms<br>
Number of bathrooms<br>

## Results
After training the model, it provides predictions on house prices based on the input features.<br> The performance of the model can be evaluated using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (RÂ²).
